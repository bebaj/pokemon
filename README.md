Fullstack React + Java Spring - home
assignment
Statement of work (SOW):
● During your work use the https://pokeapi.co/ REST API
● Enable the user to register (3rd party registration is a bonus)
● Enable the user to log in (3rd party login is a bonus)
● Show the list of pokemons catched by user and allow the user to release them
● Filter and sort the catched pokemons
● List the different types of pokemons on the main screen (use a dropdown menu or
picker)
● When a type is selected, list all the pokemon names which are assigned to this type
● Include a search bar, to enable searching in all pokemons by name
● Upon selection of a pokemon, navigate to a profile card where you show some details
about the selected pokemon
The detailed profile card needs to include: a picture of the pokemon, name of
pokemon, weight, height, not hidden abilities
● On the same screen implement a 'catch' button. On click, the pokemon should be
catched. You will need to mark the catched pokemons on the list (for example: green
border around the name). When a pokemon is catched, the button should turn to
'release', so if you want to release them back to the wild you can.
● Implement a checkbox next to the search bar to list only your catched pokemons.
● Add some navigation to go back on the webpage, and do not fetch the data again
● Use a loader / spinner while fetching data.
Requirements:
● ReactJS with Typescript and Redux state management on frontend, and Java Spring
and the database you prefer on backend. The features written in red should be
developed on the backend.
● The codebase should be expandable and scalable
● Usage of ES6
● Easy to read, DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) and well structured component based
code.
● Documentation with JSDocs, unless the code documents itself
● Backend swagger documentation
● You can use any css library of your liking, or you can write the whole on your own.
● Please use Git as version control, and share the repository with us
